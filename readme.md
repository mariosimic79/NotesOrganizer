## Notes Organizer

Notes Organizer is a web applicaton that allows users to write notes during a meeting, classes or random things. User can use basic text formats like bold, italic, underline, change the font size, and use OL and UL. User can also add pictures in his notes. Because all notes are saved in the application user can access them on other devices. If the user wants to download his notes, they will be downloaded as PDF file.  

In "DB file" folder is the database for the application. To see the working example of this application click [HERE](http://punzalogaj.com/OrganizatorBiljezaka/public/auth/login).
For username use **admin@admin.admin** and for password **administrator**
It's currently all on Croatian but I will try to translate it soon on English.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
